# Fullscreen-video-player-for-displays (im not interested in this project anymore)
This is the videoplayer if you want to put your video to the first/second monitor and it will play forever

**HOW TO OPEN THE VIDEO**



1\. you need to open cmd, to do this you press right button--> open it terminal

2\. in terminal you are writing:

player video.mp4 move.screen.\*screen\_number\*

where screen number is what screen you want to run it (instead of \*screen\_number\* use 0, 1 or 2).

move.screen.0: main screen

move.screen.1: second screen

move.screen.2: third screen



like that you can put the video in fullscreen for your monitor.



**HOW TO CLOSE THE VIDEO**



if you have in only on main screen, press "win" button and close the cmd.



if you have it opened on second screen, then go to your main screen and close the cmd.



**HOW TO OPEN YOUR OWN VIDEO**



You can put your own video, just put you video .mp4 file and run:

player \*video\_name\*.mp4 move.screen.\*screen\_number\*



**WILL IT AUTOMATICALLY OPEN WHEN PC STARTED?**



No, it will not run automatically because the creator is lazy to do that
